# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Development
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Run local checks:
   - Build the app
   - Run unit tests
   - Run lint/format (if configured)
3. Open a Pull Request describing the change.

## Commit messages
Prefer Conventional Commits (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).

## Code style
- Kotlin + Compose
- Keep modules small and focused
- Add tests for critical logic when possible
